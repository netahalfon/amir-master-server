      "passage": "When someone describes a kind person as \"having a heart of gold\", they are quoting from William Shakespeare's play Henry V. Encouraging someone to \"break the ice\" in an awkward social situation is borrowing from The Taming of the Shrew. The English language as we know it owes a great debt to the preeminent playwright, who introduced hundreds of previously unknown words and phrases into its lexicon. Shakespeare greatly enhanced the English language by altering existing words to create new ones. One type of manipulation involved combining two words to create a new term, for example, the word \"watchdog\" in reference to a person who tries to prevent wrongdoing or illegal activity. Another strategy Shakespeare employed was using nouns as verbs. He was the first person to use \"friend\" as a verb, predating Facebook by almost 400 years. Shakespeare also anglicized words from foreign languages: for example the word \"critic\", which he derived from the Greek kritikos, meaning to judge or decide. He was also fond of adding prefixes and suffixes to existing words. According to James Shapiro of Columbia University, Shakespeare invented the words unaware, uncomfortable, uneducated, fashionable, and worthless, all of which are now deeply engrained in modern vernacular. Esteemed Shakespearean scholar David Crystal asserts that \"Shakespeare teaches us to dare to be creative, to push the rules a little bit. If the word isn't there, make one up.\" And indeed, the English language continues to evolve. In 2013, \"selfie\" was named the word of the year by the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, a choice Shakespeare would undoubtedly have approved of.",

      "passage": "The sensation we refer to as pain is the result of a series of chemical reactions. When cells in the body are damaged, they release prostaglandins, chemicals that attach themselves to the nerve endings. The nerves then transmit a message to the brain, specifying the location and severity of the damage. As soon as our brain receives this message, we feel pain. At this point, we may reach for a pain reliever. Though pain relievers cannot cure disease or heal an injury, they do alleviate pain by disrupting the transmission of pain signals to the brain. There are two main kinds of medication for pain: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin, and narcotics, such as morphine and codeine. NSAIDs are used to relieve the aches and pains caused by short-term ailments such as earache and muscle sprains, or chronic illnesses like arthritis. They inhibit damaged cells from producing prostaglandins and thus limit the number of pain signals that reach the brain. The relief lasts as long as the NSAIDs remain active in the body. Narcotics act in a different way. They attach to pain receptors in the brain and spinal cord, thereby blocking the pain signals. Narcotics are generally prescribed for patients suffering from long-term or extreme pain that does not respond to NSAIDs. In some cases, however, a combination of an NSAID and a narcotic relieves pain better than either kind of medication on its own.",

      "passage": "According to researchers, habits account for about 40 percent of our behaviors on any given day. Understanding the nature of habits and learning how to form beneficial ones or change harmful ones is essential in life. For many people, however, creating new behavior patterns is an almost impossible task. The key to success lies in something called the habit loop. But briefly, a habit loop consists of a cue, a routine and a reward. In his best-selling book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg gives teeth brushing as an example. He explains that waking up in the morning with film on one's teeth is the cue that leads people to go through the routine of brushing their teeth, thereby yielding the reward of a clean and fresh feeling in their mouth. Research shows that it was the fresh taste of a new mint-flavored toothpaste called Pepsodent, in addition to the desire to remove the layer of plaque that gathers on teeth, that gave rise to the widespread practice of teeth brushing in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Customers claimed that they began looking forward to the cool and tingling sensation created by the toothpaste. The habit loop took hold and there was soon a soaring demand for Pepsodent and other mint-flavored toothpastes. In order to create a new habit or get rid of an old one it is necessary not just to identify a cue, a routine and a reward, but also to cultivate a craving that drives the loop. Duhigg explains that the reason people fail in their attempt to turn a new behavior into a set habit is that a one-time reward is not enough. Only when a behavior is repeated – and rewarded – a number of times does the brain begin anticipating the reward. Once the new routine has become automatic, a habit has been established.",

      "passage": "Medieval Italian scholar Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170-1240) ranks among the foremost mathematicians of all time. One of his most significant contributions to the field of mathematics was the dissemination of the Hindu-Arabic number system, based on the digits zero to nine (0-9), which is used all over the world today. Fibonacci first encountered Hindu-Arabic numerals when, as a child, he spent several years in North Africa with his family. Years later, he traveled widely in the Mediterranean world, delving further into the Hindu-Arabic number system and discovering its advantages over the Roman number system then in use in Europe. In 1202, after returning to his native Pisa, he published the Liber abaci (Book of Calculation), the first work to introduce Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe. Fibonacci's text demonstrated the usefulness of these numbers for practical, everyday arithmetic purposes such as money changing and the conversion of weights and measures. The book, which also discusses subjects such as geometry, algebra, and theoretical mathematics, drew the attention of leading scholars throughout Europe. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who was deeply interested in the arts and sciences, found the Liber abaci intriguing and asked to meet its author. For several years afterward, Fibonacci corresponded with the emperor and court scholars, exploring mathematical problems and their solutions. When Fibonacci published his most innovative work, the Liber quadratorum (Book of Square Numbers) in 1225, he dedicated it to the emperor. Although the Liber quadratorum was Fibonacci's most sophisticated achievement and constituted a major contribution to the field of mathematics, the Liber abaci is broader in scope and was ultimately a more influential work.",
