      "passage": "Auguste Escoffier, the foremost chef in Paris in the late 1800s, ran the most glamorous and expensive restaurant in the city. There he created meals that surpassed anything his customers had ever experienced. The wonderful taste was attributed to veal stock, the innovative basis of most of Escoffier’s scrumptious dishes. It deepened and enriched the flavor of everything it touched. So extraordinary was his cooking that it defied the accepted notion that humans could taste only four flavors: salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. In fact, Escoffier believed he had discovered a new category of taste, though he lacked the scientific means to prove it.\n\nIn 1907, a Japanese chemist named Kikunae Ikeda had a similar insight. Enjoying a bowl of dashi, a classic Japanese soup made from seaweed, Ikeda sensed that the flavor was not one of the four recognized tastes. He went into his laboratory, determined to find the mysterious component. A year later his findings were published in the Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo. Claiming that the elusive flavor came from glutamic acid, he called this fifth taste “umami”, a name derived from the Japanese word umai, meaning “delicious”. Unlike Escoffier, Ikeda had offered scientific proof. Still, nobody believed him.\n\nAlmost a hundred years later, a new generation of scientists took a closer look at the human tongue. Their findings confirmed the claims of Escoffier and Ikeda. Apparently, humans have taste receptors for a substance called L-glutamate. When we eat something that is particularly delicious in a way not identifiable as sweet, sour, bitter, or salty, what we are tasting is umami.",

      "passage": "Malaria is the most prevalent parasitic disease in the world, affecting ten percent of the global population. It proves fatal for a million or more people per year. Almost all of the deaths occur in impoverished sub-Saharan Africa, and most of those who succumb to the disease are children under the age of five.\n\nThe link between malaria and poverty in the world’s underdeveloped countries is stronger than is generally acknowledged. “Where malaria prospers most, human societies have prospered least,” says economist Jeffrey Sachs. Reducing the incidence of malaria by means of drugs could be an extremely cost-effective way of promoting development and prosperity. However, international pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to fund extensive research into vaccines and drugs to combat a disease that primarily strikes countries that are unable to pay for treatment. On the other hand, the international community has launched some positive initiatives. For example, the World Health Organization has instituted the Roll Back Malaria campaign, the current goal of which is to eliminate all deaths caused by the disease by 2030. Also, the United Nations has established the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The methods employed include distribution of insecticide-treated sleeping nets and the administration of existing drugs in various combinations.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of insufficient funding, none of these efforts is likely to make great headway. An effective program to battle malaria in Africa alone would cost roughly $2 billion per year, yet global spending on attempts to fight the disease amounts to less than $100 million annually. Although $2 billion seems an astronomical sum, economists estimate that the expenditure would, in the long run, save Africa’s economy $12 billion each year. Not only would the benefit clearly exceed the cost in dollars and cents, but millions of lives would be saved.",

      "passage": "“My trouble and strife is out with the tin lids. I’m on my Pat Malone.” This seemingly nonsensical statement actually makes perfect sense to anyone who knows Australian rhyming slang. We are all familiar with slang – an informal, often playful, sometimes puzzling way of speaking – but Australian rhyming slang is especially complex: a word is replaced by a word or phrase that rhymes with it but seems not to belong in the sentence. For example, instead of “Answer the phone,” an Australian might say “Answer the dog and bone.” In some cases, the rhyming phrase becomes shortened so that the rhyme no longer exists. Thus, the slang for “I got hit on my head” is “I got hit on my loaf of bread,” which becomes “I got hit on my loaf.” Some phrases are particularly difficult for foreigners to understand because they are based on local culture and slang. Thus, “Our team had a real shocker” (a really bad game) becomes “Our team had a real Barry Crocker” (a reference to a popular Australian entertainer), which is then shortened to “Our team had a real Barry.”\n\nIt is commonly believed that Australian rhyming slang grew out of Cockney rhyming slang, which developed in the East End of London in the 1840s, and out of Irish rhyming slang. In the 1800s, Australia was settled by large numbers of immigrants from Britain and Ireland, so it is possible that they brought this manner of speaking with them. However, some people think that it developed independently in Australia. Today, most young Australians, especially in the large cities, consider rhyming slang old-fashioned. In many circles, however, it is still alive and well.\n\nNow, back to the opening sentence. Almost any Australian could tell you that “My trouble and strife is out with the tin lids. I’m on my Pat Malone” means “My wife is out with the kids. I’m on my own.”",

      "passage": "In the world of toys, where new ideas lose their charm alarmingly quickly, a small bottle containing soapy liquid used to blow bubbles has been a constant favorite since the 1940s. According to one current industry estimate, 200 million bottles of bubble liquid are sold annually. Tim Kehoe, a toy inventor from St. Paul, Minnesota, dreamed of taking the classic, transparent bubble one step further. He devoted eleven years of his life to creating colored bubbles – bubbles of a single vibrant hue, be it green, blue, or pink.\n\nThe realization of Kehoe’s dream proved to be no simple undertaking. In the process, he stained his car, several bathtubs, and a few dozen children. He ruined kitchen countertops and corporate conference tables, and caused a chemical fire or two. Eventually, he succeeded in making colored bubbles with a dye that could be washed off skin and clothing, but market research showed that the product was still not ready. Even temporary stains horrified parents. Unfortunately for Kehoe, in the history of organic chemistry no one had ever created a water-soluble dye that faded spontaneously.\n\nKehoe called in Dr. Ram Sabnis, one of a handful of experts on dye chemistry in the world. Sabnis, who eventually solved the problem, says the project was the most difficult he had ever worked on. “Nobody has made this chemistry before. We have synthesized a whole new class of dyes.” Zubbles, the product of Sabnis and Kehoe’s collaboration, appeared on the market in 2009 – to the delight of bubble lovers big and small.",
