It is often called wild carrot because it is related to the vegetable that we eat. In fact, if you rub and then sniff the plant's leaves, you will find that they smell like carrots.\n\nQueen Anne's lace has a circle of small, white flowers at the top of its long stem. Because of the way these tiny, delicate flowers are grouped together, they look like lace. There is a purple flower at the center of the cluster, making it seem as if a beetle is sitting there.\n\nNo one is sure which Queen Anne the wildflower is named for. According to one story, it was named after the wife of King James I of England, who was originally from Denmark. When she came to England to marry the king, Anne saw wild carrot for the first time. She thought it so pretty that she decided to make lace that looked like the flower and sew it onto her dresses. Eventually, people began calling the plant by her name.",

      "passage": "Human history is replete with figures who foretell future events, from the soothsayers and oracles of the ancient world to present-day clairvoyants and fortune-tellers. One of the most riveting of these is Nostradamus, a sixteenth-century physician who has been hailed as a veritable prophet and condemned as a fraud.\n\nIn 1547, Nostradamus began making predictions about the future, which he collected in a book called The Prophecies (often referred to as The Centuries). Rarely out of print since its publication in 1555, the book consists of rhymed four-line verses called quatrains, each purporting to foretell some world event far in the future. The predictions themselves are vague, even cryptic. They include few dates or names and are not arranged in chronological order. Nostradamus claimed they were based on divine inspiration, meditation, and the movements of the stars and planets, and that their meaning would become clear in time.\n\nRetrospective interpretation of the prophecies has led enthusiasts to credit Nostradamus with foretelling such momentous events as the French Revolution, both world wars, and the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Most academic sources, however, claim that Nostradamus deliberately wrote his quatrains in imprecise language so that they could be given a number of meanings in years to come. They also point out that predictions of death, war, and natural disasters – all of which inevitably occur over the course of history – are hardly a testimony to Nostradamus's prophetic powers.",

    "passage": "One of the best ways to help the environment is also one of the simplest. Each year, the average family produces more than 350 kilograms of biodegradable waste – waste which can be broken down naturally into nutrients and used by other organisms. Usually, this 'green' waste is hauled away along with other household garbage and buried in huge dumps and landfills. At best, these sites occupy valuable land and generate unpleasant odors; at worst, they create serious environmental hazards. Because buried biodegradable waste is not exposed to air, it rots, producing methane gas and acids which pollute the air, soil, and underground water sources. There is, however, a better way to deal with green waste. With very little effort, our eggshells, coffee grounds, and wilted lettuce leaves can be turned into wonderful fertilizer for our gardens and houseplants.\n\nComposting, turning green waste into fertilizer, dates back to ancient times. It requires no agronomic skill: anyone can learn how to compost in a matter of minutes. Biodegradable waste is placed in an open container, where it is kept damp and mixed regularly. The waste decomposes with the help of bacteria, earthworms, insects, and fungi. And because it is exposed to air – unlike waste buried in landfills – it does not rot.\n\nComposting has grown in popularity as people have become more environmentally aware. It not only creates a useful product, but also decreases the need for landfills, lessens reliance on chemical fertilizers, and reduces the number of garbage trucks polluting the air. Moreover, composting entails very little expense and can be done by individuals or groups of concerned citizens.",

    "passage": "The Latin phrase solvitur ambulando ('it is solved by walking') is often used when discussing the centuries-old belief that walking has a myriad of benefits. Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, was well known for his practice of thinking while strolling and would often teach while walking the grounds of his academy in Athens. Aristotle was aware of walking's contribution to health and importance for cognitive function. He was not the only prominent historical figure to adhere to the ethos of walking.\n\nMany writers and artists have been avid walkers, insisting that their walking routine was part of their creative process. The long nature walks favored by German composer Ludwig van Beethoven inspired many of his works, most notably his Pastoral Symphony. For English poet William Wordsworth, the act of walking was inseparable from the act of writing. He both wrote and revised lines of poetry while hiking, the rhythm of his steps influencing the rhythm of his works. And the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau was convinced that walking was indispensable for the well-being of both body and mind. He declared, 'I cannot preserve my health and spirits unless I spend four hours a day at least … sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields.'\n\nAre the claims that walking enhances creativity purely speculative? Dr. Paul Sowden, a professor of psychology, has noted: 'Walking has been shown to improve our ability to shift between modes of thought and to improve our attention, memory, and recovery from mental fatigue, all of which are important for thinking creatively.' Researchers Marily Oppezzo and Daniel Schwartz of Stanford University explored the purported link between walking and creativity. In one of their experiments, subjects were asked to brainstorm ideas under four different conditions: sitting indoors, walking on a treadmill indoors, being wheeled around outside in a wheelchair, and walking outdoors. The results, reported in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition in 2014, provided measurable evidence to support the notion of solvitur ambulando for anyone facing the challenge of generating new ideas.",
